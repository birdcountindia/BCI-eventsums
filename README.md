There are several birding events that occur over the course of a year in India. Much of the success of these events rides on the strength of people's engagement. One way of improving engagement is by providing summary statistics of the event and encouraging people with numbers.

This repo contains the code for event summaries provided _after_ the event, using the EBD data download.
